# Out-of-Bounds Array Access in Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart programming: accessing an array element using an index that is out of bounds.  The example code attempts to access the element at index 5 in a list of length 5, which results in an error. The solution shows how to avoid this error using a range check or other error handling techniques.
